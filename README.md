# voiceAtis
Reads an ATIS from IVAO using voice generation.

## Requirements
* XPlane with [XPUIPC](http://fsacars.com/downloads/xpuipc/) **-or-** 
* FSX, P3D with [FSUIPC](http://www.schiratti.com/dowson.html)

## Installation
* Get the latest release from the [releases tab](https://github.com/Sowintuu/voiceAtis/releases).
* Unzip the folder.

## Usage
* Start your sim and start a flight.
* Start the voiceAtis.exe file in the unziped folder.
   * **Note that you must start the .exe as admin if you have started your sim as admin!**
* Tune the ATIS frequency of the airport where you are parking.
   * Don't forget to activate receive mode of the radio (COM1 or COM2)
* You should hear the ATIS now, if:
   * There is an ATC station online at this airport (TWR, APP, GND or DEL)
   * The airport has an ATIS frequency at [ourairports.com](http://ourairports.com)
* If there is an frequency, but no station only, voiceAtis will read the current METAR only.

### Custom airport data
Airport data is downloaded from [ourairports.com](http://ourairports.com). You can see these data at `airports.info` file at main directory. It may happen that this data is inaccurate or an airport is missing.

In this case you can add the airport to the `airports_add.info` file. Airports in this file have priority over downloaded data.

You may also inform me about wrong data preferably via the Issues tab. I will then enter the data at [ourairports.com](http://ourairports.com) to distritbute them to all users. Alternatively, after login, you may correct the data on your own.

### Notice for X-Plane users
X-Plane has its own ATIS information broadcasted, often on the same (real) frequency. After tuning in the ATIS frequency you will hear the X-Plane ATIS message first and then the message provided by voiceAtis. Because X-Plane also uses the operation system text-to-speech machine like voiceAtis, the voice messages are queued and read after each other.

To avoid the broadcast of the default ATIS, I added the script `disableXpAtis.lua` which is located in the supportFiles folder. You must have [FlyWithLua](https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/files/file/38445-flywithlua-ng-next-generation-edition-for-x-plane-11-win-lin-mac/) installed and add the script to the FlyWithLua Scripts folder.

### Notice for FSX users
FSX also has its own ATIS information broadcasted on the same frequency. It uses its own voice engine thus doesn't interfer with voiceAtis. Nevertheless the spoken messages and the displayed text may be disturbing. To disable them uncheck the following options.
* Options > General > All ATC options
* Options > Sounds > Voice

### Notice for P3D users
I don't own P3D but voiceAtis was tested up to v0.3.0 and it worked. 

To disable the default ATIS in P3D follow these steps:
Disable ATIS Voice: Options > General > Sound > Uncheck "Voice"
Disable ATIS Text: Options > General > Information > Uncheck "Show message log in ATC menu"

## Bugs and issues
* Please report bugs via the github issues tab.
    * It is usefull to attach the logfile from the "logs" folder.
    
### Known limitations
* METAR
    * No trend
    * No visibility directions
    * No runway condition
* IvAc 2 support discontinued
   * Reading ATIS from IvAc 2 works. However there are bugs and this wont be improved.
   * Remarks of ivac 2 stations will not be read.
* X-Plane: Detection of active radio not accurate
* Sometimes airports have more than 1 ATIS frequency (e.g. EDDF or LOWW, for departure and arrival)
    * You might have to try all frequencies to find the one working.
    * Check [ourairports.com](http://ourairports.com) for the (real world) frequencies.

## Build
### Requirements
* Python 3.8 - 32 bit (due to pyuipc incompatibility with 64 bit)
* pywin32

### Installation
* Get the latest python 3.8 ([Python releases](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
* Install the latest pywin32 release (`pip install pywin32`)
* Run `pip install voiceAtis`

OurAirports is a free site where visitors can explore the world's airports, read other people's comments, and leave their own. The help pages have information to get you started.

The site is dedicated to both passengers and pilots. You can create a map of the airports you've visited and share that map with friends. You can find the closest airports to you, and discover the ones that you haven't visited yet.

Behind the fun and features, OurAirports exists primarily as a public good. When Australia forced the US government to shut down public access to its Digital Aeronautical Flight Information File (DAFIF) service in 2006, there was no longer a good source of global aviation data. OurAirports started in 2007 primarily to fill that gap: we encourage members to create and maintain data records for airports around the world, and they manage over 40,000 of them. Many web sites, smartphone apps, and other services rely on OurAirport's data, which is all in the Public Domain (no permission required).
